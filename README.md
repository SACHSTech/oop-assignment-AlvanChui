## Summary

This system models the well-known Game store Application *Steam*. In the application, the user can use the store page to view and buy games, access his own game library, add friends and check their status, as well as view & customize their own profile (they can view and change it in the profile page later on). In this program, the user will firt input their user information in the log in screen, then they will be logged in and can use the store page, games library, friend list and their own profile. They are allowed to deposit money into their steam wallet in the log in screen and the profile settings page. Then they can use the money to buy games in the store page. This adds the game into their games library so they can access the game. They are also allowed to view their friends' status, search & add new friends in the friends page.
